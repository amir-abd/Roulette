## Overview:
This is my first project @ General assembly. I decided to build a Roulette game. 

## User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to select the area of my bet.
As a user, I want a spin button before the roulette starts spinning.
As a user, I want to see how much money I have left at any time.
As a user, I want a reset button, so that I can play again with the starting money.
As a user, I want to see when any of my bets win.
